        “First of all it boots up very quick. It is mentioned up to 12 minutes, but I was able to boot it up with Free tier subscription (t2.micro free usage option) within 5 minutes. The CA and the mind-aching stuff is done within that minutes and all you have to do is to run the script mentoned in documentation and the deal is done.”

        “Gone are the days when it would take hours to set up an OpenVPN server and get client connections up and running. This awesome system from 0x4447 LLC just took me 10 minutes to get up and running. I could create client configurations in a jiffy and what's more? I was able to scale-down or scale-up my instance without worrying about losing my connections!”

    The limits depend on the instance type that you select, rather than on arbitrary soft limits that you'll see with much of the competition.

    The limiting factor is<br>
          <span class="text-primary">the server performance</span>.
  text: >-
    If your user starts to complain about a slow connection, or if you see the CPU time is above 75 percent,
          then just change the server to a bigger instance type to accommodate the new traffic and users.
